# **Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory**

## **1. Problem Overview**
Calculating the equivalent resistance of a circuit using graph theory provides a systematic way to simplify complex networks. Instead of manually applying series and parallel resistance rules, we model the circuit as a weighted graph:

- **Nodes** represent circuit junctions.
- **Edges** represent resistors, with weights equal to their resistance values.

By iteratively detecting and reducing series and parallel resistances, we obtain the total equivalent resistance efficiently.

## **2. Algorithm Description**
The algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Graph Representation**: Convert the circuit into an adjacency list representation.
2. **Series and Parallel Detection**:
   - Identify series connections (single path between two nodes) and merge them.
   - Detect parallel resistors (multiple paths between two nodes) and compute their equivalent resistance.
3. **Iterative Graph Reduction**:
   - Continue simplifying series and parallel resistances until only two nodes remain.
4. **Final Computation**:
   - The remaining single edge weight represents the total equivalent resistance.

## **3. Python Implementation**
Below is a Python implementation using a graph-based approach:

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class CircuitGraph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = {}  # Adjacency list representation

    def add_resistor(self, node1, node2, resistance):
        if node1 not in self.graph:
            self.graph[node1] = []
        if node2 not in self.graph:
            self.graph[node2] = []
        self.graph[node1].append((node2, resistance))
        self.graph[node2].append((node1, resistance))

    def simplify_series(self):
        for node in list(self.graph.keys()):
            if len(self.graph[node]) == 2:
                (n1, r1), (n2, r2) = self.graph[node]
                equivalent_resistance = r1 + r2
                self.graph[n1].remove((node, r1))
                self.graph[n2].remove((node, r2))
                self.graph[n1].append((n2, equivalent_resistance))
                self.graph[n2].append((n1, equivalent_resistance))
                del self.graph[node]

    def simplify_parallel(self):
        for node in self.graph:
            connections = {}
            for neighbor, resistance in self.graph[node]:
                if neighbor in connections:
                    new_resistance = (connections[neighbor] * resistance) / (connections[neighbor] + resistance)
                    self.graph[node] = [(n, r) for n, r in self.graph[node] if n != neighbor]
                    self.graph[node].append((neighbor, new_resistance))
                    self.graph[neighbor] = [(n, r) for n, r in self.graph[neighbor] if n != node]
                    self.graph[neighbor].append((node, new_resistance))
                else:
                    connections[neighbor] = resistance

    def calculate_equivalent_resistance(self, start, end):
        while len(self.graph) > 2:
            self.simplify_series()
            self.simplify_parallel()

        if start in self.graph and len(self.graph[start]) > 0:
            return self.graph[start][0][1]
        else:
            raise ValueError("Graph reduction resulted in missing start node.")

    def plot_graph(self, title="Circuit Graph"):
        G = nx.Graph()
        for node in self.graph:
            for neighbor, resistance in self.graph[node]:
                G.add_edge(node, neighbor, weight=resistance)

        pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
        labels = {(u, v): f"{d['weight']}Î©" for u, v, d in G.edges(data=True)}

        plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
        nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color="lightblue", node_size=2000, font_size=12)
        nx.draw_networkx_edge_labels(G, pos, edge_labels=labels)
        plt.title(title)
        plt.show()
